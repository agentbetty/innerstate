					<h1>about me</h1>
					
					<h2>Hello!</h2>
					
					<p>I am an Art Director and Design Strategist working in <em>sunny Portland, OR</em>. I started my career as a graphic designer and Flash developer. As my career has evolved I have had many roles within user experience: information architect, content strategist, experience designer, front-end developer, brand strategist, and creative director.</p> 

					<blockquote>I maintain a strong, formal design sensibility alongside a love for how things are built, how we manage that building process, and how we keep it all centered on the user.</blockquote>

					<p>After working within the Agile development process&mdash;in order to incorporate engaging design&mdash;I’ve found that I am interested in that sweet spot where iterative development marries with a beautifully executed UCD. I am interested in both outputs (performance) and outcomes (value) and how we can leverage both for a successful and engaging experience.</p>
					
					<p>As UX, especially within mobile matures, users are less enticed by a feature-centric development approach and seek value and a better quality experience. That requires a rethinking and retooling of the development and design philosophies. That requires the features we provide bet vetted, stable, and quickly available, but afforded a seat in the back in favor of information, value, and entertainment.</p> 

					<p>Taking into account my respect for iterative development and my love of design, I’m left with a few questions:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>How can we ensure UX and “big design” iterate successfully and maintain solvency within the Agile environment?</li>

						<li>Can having a CPSO that understands the full breadth of user experience help facilitate both a successful MVP (output) and a strong and usable design (outcome)?</li>
					</ul>
