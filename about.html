					<h1>about me</h1>
					
					<h2>things that got me where i am today</h2>
					
					<p>I am a creative director and design strategist working in <em>sunny</em> Portland, OR. I started my career as a graphic designer and Flash developer. As my career has evolved I have had many roles within user experience: information architect, content strategist, experience designer, front-end developer, brand strategist, and creative director.</p>

					<p>I maintain a strong, formal design sensibility alongside a love for how things are built, how we manage that building process, and how we keep it all centered on the user.</p>
					
					<h2>questions that will get me where i am tomorrow</h2>
					
					<p>After working with Agile teams in order to incorporate engaging design, I’ve found that I am interested in that sweet spot where iterative development marries with a beautifully executed UCD.</p> 

					<p>As UX, especially within mobile, matures, users are less enticed by a feature-centric development approach and want more quality, more value, and a better quality experience. That requires a rethinking and retooling of the development and design philosophies.</p>

					<ul class="questions">
						<li>How can we ensure UX and “big design” iterate successfully within the Agile environment?</li> 

						<li>Can haveing a CPSO that understands the full breadth of user experience help facilitate a strong project output (sucessful MVP) and strong project outcome (successful and usable design)? How valuable is it to the Agile process to have a CPSO that understands and advocates for a strong design?</li>
					</ul>
