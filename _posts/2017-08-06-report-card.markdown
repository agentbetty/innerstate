title: National Report Card
section1-title: The Challenge
section1-para1: A national agency created-program to evaluate the education progress of elementary, middle, and high school students across the nation in key learning areas. This site is essentially a web application where users are asked to report data on students and their performance at different intervals over an academic year.
section1-para2: Why and where are users struggling with the tasks on this site?
section1-para3: How do we help them be successful?

section3-title: User Journey Maps
section3-img: /img/reportcard/reportcard-UJM-1.jpg
section3-img-alt: Example of user journey map
section3-para1: We created user journey maps in order to have a clear left-to-right view of their engagement arc with the web app. User touchpoints with the site were spread throughout an academic year and fluctuated between sporadic and frequent. These assets were particularly beneficial because they were a touchpoint as we developed the content strategy and UX for each phase of the journey.
section3-h3: Key User Concerns
section3-para2: Lack of familiarity with the site. Few repeat users from year to year.
section3-para3: Tech insecurity. Users, already experiencing insecurity around technology, were frustrated and confused.

section4-img7-alt: Wireframe for Representative Workflow
section4-para: We chose to provide a set of medium-fidelity wireframes that include examples of tone and voice, recommended content length, a color language, annotations, and other design elements. Please note, the copy, colors, and typography are not final or part of a branding or content strategy; they are meant to be examples that are inline with our recommendations.
blockquote: We provided the team that administrates the site a robust documentation set (see below) that included three key UX areas to target &mdash;task wayfinding, content strategy, and contextual help&mdash;and a road map for implementation. Additionally, we provided a set of design patterns such as form workflows, navigation best practices, reward language, and many others for them to implement through out their properties and collateral.
