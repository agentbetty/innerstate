bio-1: The Center for Behavioral Health Policy Studies at Emory University wanted to research study participantsâ€™ activity levels and assist with nutrition education, so we built an Android app they could distribute to participants.
bio-2: We designed an app with an easy-to-use interface for novice users in order to track participant activity and weight loss, provide healthy eating tips, and facilitate interaction with a health coach. 
bio-3: The app features include a pedometer, calorie and diet monitors, daily milestones, congratulatory notifications, and food choice education.
