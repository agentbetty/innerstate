title: Cancer Trials
section1-title: The Challenge
section1-para1: This cancer trial database is a service of a large government agency and is designed to facilitate access to hundreds of government-funded clinical trials and to support the management and conduct of those clinical trials. I was tasked with demonstrating the viability and value of a tablet-based, UX overhaul.
section1-para2: How could a tablet-first web app be utilized by our users in clinics, offices, and hospitals?
section1-para3: How can I improve their workflow both inside and outside of the system?
section2-title: My Process
section2-para1: I began by interviewing users regarding their usage of the current site while also gathering information from the client-side development team. I took my lessons learned from the user interviews and created two documents. <b>First, a backlog and personas to help inform the release phases and acceptance criteria, and secondly conceptual wires illustrating two theoretical directions for the app&#58; (1) Smart Search & Find and (2) Collaboration.</b>
section2-para2: The former focused on streamlining the user experience into a simple and clear layout that facilitated easy access to protocol documents and site registration statuses. The latter was a much loftier approach that organized the content in areas to foster collaboration and discussion as well as extending the functionality to support these interactions.

section3-im2g-alt: Collaborate, Phase 2 Conceptual Wireframe
section3-para1: I created user journey maps in order to have a clear left-to-right view of their engagement arc with the web app. User touchpoints with the site were spread throughout an academic year and fluctuated between sporadic and frequent. These assets were particularly beneficial because they were a touchpoint as I developed the content strategy and UX for each phase of the journey.
section3-h3: Key User Concerns
section3-para2: Lack of familiarity with the site. Few repeat users from year to year.
section3-para3: Tech insecurity. Users, already experiencing insecurity around technology, were frustrated and confused.

section4-para: I moved forward with Direction 1&#58; Smart Search & Find for this initial phase but discussed how elements from Direction 2 could be integrated later in the project. This direction allowed for three entries into the data&#58; search by protocol number (very common), browse protocols, and view saved protocols. Wireframes were created to illustrate the chosen direction and give our design and development teams references to begin building the project. I broke up this work into 5 releases, leading into final testing and documentation sprints. During each Release, I provided the team with acceptance criteria to approve, not approve, and comment on.
