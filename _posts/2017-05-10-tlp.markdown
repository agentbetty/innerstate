bio-1: The Department of Education's Teacher and Leadership Programs comprise of 5 cohorts of grant recipient schools and districts.
bio-2: I first created a brand family and style guide for each of the programs and extended the existing parent style guide to reflect the updated look (and make it 508 compliant.) 
bio-3: I then applied this strategy to update a rather complicated Drupal user experience (many types of authenticated and non-authenticated user stories) and a large set of educational materials to support the grantees and the great work they do in our education system.
