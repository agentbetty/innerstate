bio-1: This multi-site Drupal project included a main, district site as well as 29 elementary, middle, and high school sites.
bio-2: We worked with the team at Bend La-Pine to develop a strong, online presence with clear access to important information at the district level while carving out spaces for schools to have their own, personalized sites within the district's ecosystem.
bio-3: Migrating all of these schools sites as well as updating the district site to include responsive, information-focused design gave educators the platform to share important news and events, while creating a clear path to information and peace of mind for busy parents.
