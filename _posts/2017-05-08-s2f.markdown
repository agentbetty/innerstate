bio-1: In 2011 we began working with the USDA to design and develop Start2Farm.gov&#58; an online database connecting beginning farmers and ranchers with available programs and resources.
bio-2: Our Drupal site managed complicated taxomonies and faceted search (using <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a>) in order to provide a smart and easy-to-access aggregation of farming and ranching resources.
bio-3: In 2015, the site content was merged into the USDA's newfarmers.usda.gov.
