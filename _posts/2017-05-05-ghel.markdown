bio-1: GHeL provides online courses and certificate programs for global health professionals.
bio-2: I expanded their underutilized brand with a fresh color palette and strategy alongside a new, vibrant visual refresh. We also implemented course and certificate recommendations, faceted searches, card filtering, and an upgraded dashboard to support these health professionals in their learning.
bio-3: Alongside extending the brand and creating a refresh, I worked with a team to flesh out wire frames for a holistic and intuitive user experience.
