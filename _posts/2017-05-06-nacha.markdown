bio-1: Over our 3-year engagement with NACHA, I worked with teams internal to NACHA and our own set of developers, designers, and content strategist to evolve the online presence of the Association.
bio-2: I redesigned and themed their main Drupal site&mdash;alongside our Content Strategist&mdash; I developed a Communication Strategy that incorporated their new online brand strategy with guidelines for fresh tone and content.
bio-3: I continued to support NACHA with visual updates to the site, a continued evolution of their messaging in both print and online media, as well as help them maintain a strong, trusted voice in the financial payments community.
